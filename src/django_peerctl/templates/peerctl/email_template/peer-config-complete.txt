Dear {{ peer.company_name }},

We would like to advise you that we have configured the following sessions:

{% for session in sessions %}{{ session.ip4 }} {{ session.ip6 }} - {{ session.peer_ip4 }} {{ session.peer_ip6 }}
{% endfor %}
You will see the sessions come up, but we will not send or accept any routes until the session(s) have been up and stable for at least 24 hours.  It may take several days before we begin sending and accepting routes.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

{{ my.company_name }} Peering
